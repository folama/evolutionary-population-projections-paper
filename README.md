# bayesTFR-evo-code

This repository contains the R code used to generate the simulations and charts in the working paper "Natural selection makes world population stabilisation unlikely in the foreseeable future" (link to be provided when available). The simulations use an amended "evolutionary" version of the R package [bayesTFR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bayesTFR/index.html). The evolutionary version can be found at [github](https://github.com/jasonacollins/bayesTFR).

This repository also contains the summary simulation results used in the paper.
